# Modded Minecraft Malware "fractureiser"
*Pardon our dust, documentation not finalized*

This is a living document that is being edited by multiple people about a developing situation. 

We apologize for the inconvenience of any formatting issues, this means that some sections may be messy.

## What?
`fractureiser` is a [Virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus) found in several Minecraft projects uploaded to CurseForge and CraftBukkit's dev website. The malware is embedded in multiple mods, some of which were added to highly popular modpacks.

If left unchecked, fractureiser can be **INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS** to your machine. Please read through this document for the info you need to keep yourself safe.

We've dubbed this malware `fractureiser` because that's the name of the CurseForge account that uploaded the most notable malicious files.

## Current Investigation Status
We have a good idea how fractureiser works, from Stages 0 to 3. There are certain
unknowns, but Stage 0 bootstrapping was quickly nipped and tomorrow we'll be moving our
focus to mitigation.

Work has begun on a detector for infected Stage 0 mods:
https://github.com/MCRcortex/nekodetector and arranging for this detector to be run on
Modrinth.

The threat actors attempted to bring up a new server IP. In the process, they accidentally
uploaded an unobfuscated version of Stage 3. This allowed us to further understand the
malware and what it does.

As of the time of writing this new control IP has been taken offline by its hosting provider.
